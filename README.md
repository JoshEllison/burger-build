### Burger Builder Application w/ ReactJS - https://burger-builder-211.firebaseapp.com/
This is a simple react demo project where a user can create a burger and order it after logging in. Users are only allowed to see their own orders and are routed to the correct steps conditionally.

## Goals With Building This Application
The goals of building this App were to: 
- Create modularized React components and access them using Redux and the Redux middleware Thunk. 
- Handle authentification with tokens and local storage opposed to dropping in a pre build authentification option from firebase. 
- Utilize the power of asynchronous code.
- Design tests for components, containers, and reducers using Jest and Enzyme.
 
## Technology Used
- React 16 / Jsx pages
- React Router
- Redux
- Redux Thunk middleware
- Axios with promises
- Webpack
- Babel
- JavaScript (ES6) with async
- HTML5
- CSS3 w/ Mobile First
- FireBase for Database
- Jest and Enzyme

## Takeaway
The combination of these technologies enabled easier handling of state throughout the application and a simpiler implementation of asynchronous code. Adding complexity to a project is much easier to accomplish in this modular format than traditional React state handling.
